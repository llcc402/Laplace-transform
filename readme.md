# Laplace transform

We decompose the normalized graph Laplacian matrix using svd and return the eigen vectors as transformed data.

See http://www.kyb.mpg.de/fileadmin/user_upload/files/publications/attachments/Luxburg07_tutorial_4488[0].pdf for detail.

Run main.m as an example. It shows the Laplace transform can change non-linear-separable data to linear separable.
